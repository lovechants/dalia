###### Notes 
Thought about using C++23 I just like the C++20 std at times and Valerie eninge is already in C++20.
I like `std::print` from C++23 so just remade the wrapper.
Test suites and visualizations are important to me and fun so trying to have alot of built in tooling.
Thought about writing it in Rust, but wrote too much at the beginning of the year and end of last year to feel motivated to write in it.
